# Reproducible Scientific Computing in Python - 2020-02-18

This repository is a companion to the 90 minute tutorial I gave as a guest
speaker in the Mechanism Enrichment Lab taught by Daniel Domingo-Fern√°ndez
on February 18th, 2020 as part of the Winter Semester 2019/2020 in the Life
Science Informatics master's program in the Bonn-Aachen International Center

This tutorial covered:

1. Structuring a Python package using the `src/` layout
2. Preparation for installation with `pip` using `setup.py`/`setup.cfg`
3. Documentation style and type annotations
4. Making a command interface with `click`
